## 4. UPDATE FOR USER SUBMISSION:

**Updates for User Submission with the other addtional pages–** 
	We still have the data collection page this time, which collects basic personal information about the user, but we will completely change this part. We are going to make it so that this page will become an HTML form and have the function to collect and save the data inputted by the user. This will be added so that our website will look more complete and professional, which also comes with being functional. We will also add another page that will calculate the prices for your donations. Although this function already exists in existing pages, it is more convenient to skip the descriptions of all pages and go straight to the calculations when you need it, rather than to go through all of those pages.

	Overall, our updates to our website will help make it more professional with the help of using an HTML form to collect data. It will also be easier to use and access our services for calculating the prices of the users’ donations, as well as the modes of payment. We have chosen to keep it simple and only add a few modifications as for the most part, we think that our website is almost complete.
